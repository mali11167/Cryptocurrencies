# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
In this project we used unsupervised learning model. We used unsupervised learning to see how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. 
We are going to see what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
